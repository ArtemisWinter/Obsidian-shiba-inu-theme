## To-read

I am looking for designers who want to be part of the Shiba Inu team, if you are interested and are willing to contribute to the theme, feel free to contact me on discord; [Farouk#9239](https://discord.com/) or on the forum; [Farouk](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/Farouk/summary).

**I highly recommend to install the Style Settings plugin in the Plugins Community Store for a more pleasant use of the theme.**
